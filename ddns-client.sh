## WARNING
# One means of executing this method involves the storing of a password in plaintext
# in the user's crontab.
# Ideally, you would use an RSA key to connect instead for better security.
# You have been warned.
#
## USAGE
# COMPUTER ATTACHED TO THE NETWORK WITH THE WAN DYNAMIC IP ADDRESS.
# Must have an ssh client installed.
# Must have sshpass installed if you are using password authentication.
# Place ddns-client.sh (this file) into ~/scripts
#
# SERVER WITH VISTA CP.
# Place index.php into /home/{username}/web/{domain name}/{public_html or public_shtml}/ip 
# (or public_shtml, dependent if you are serving SSL from a different folder)
# Place ddns-server.sh into ~/scripts of your admin user home directory.
# Edit ~/.bashrc in the admin user home directory to include the contents
# of the included .bashrc file.
#
# Add the following command to the user's cron at your frequency of choice:
# bash ddns-client.sh {URL to index.php} {server domain name} {vesta username} {domain} {subdomain} {server admin username} {server admin password} 
# You only need to include the server admin password if you did not set up an ssh key.
# See: http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html for more information.
